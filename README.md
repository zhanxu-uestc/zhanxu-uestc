## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I received the B.Sc degree from the School of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China, in 2018. I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree there. My research explores
 radar imaging with a spirit of computational imaging, particularly for 3D radar imaging (near-field array-SAR, tomoSAR, etc.)
